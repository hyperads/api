#### JSON Response key parameters

* `status` – Always `OK` if the request was processed successfully

#### User

* `user.key` – Unique user `GUID`, which is generated on each request or sent from the `user_key` GET variable.
When an ad is being requested, the user identifier, which is stored in app, is sent to `user_key`. For the first request nothing is sent, as the identifier does not exist yet. The Ad server generates a new `GUID` and sends it in the response, 
the SDK saves the identifier in the app. The next requests can use this identifier.
